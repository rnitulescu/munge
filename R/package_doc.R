#' A package for efficient data summarization using data.table
#'
#' The munge package provides the main workhorse function \code{munge}, which
#' takes care of all the data summarizing automatically, as long as the input data
#' are properly formatted. The package will be extended to add functions for formating
#' the default output further for publication-quality output in various file formats (tex, html).
#' The package also provides a few other utility functions useful for data investigations such as
#' \code{checkDups}.
